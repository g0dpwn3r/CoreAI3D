# Security

## Security Overview

The CoreAI3D project prioritizes security awareness and proactive measures to protect users, contributors, and the software ecosystem. We emphasize staying well-informed about emerging security risks and vulnerabilities through continuous monitoring of relevant sources, including security advisories, industry reports, and community discussions. While we strive for robust security practices, we acknowledge that no system is entirely risk-free and accept certain calculated risks based on the project's scope and resources.

## Risk Management

Risk management in CoreAI3D involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential security threats. We evaluate risks on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as impact severity, likelihood of occurrence, and available mitigation strategies. Calculated risks are accepted when they align with project goals and do not compromise core functionality or user safety. This approach allows us to balance innovation with security without over-engineering solutions.

## Vulnerability Handling

Security patches and updates for the CoreAI3D software are handled personally by the project maintainer(s). This ensures direct oversight and timely application of fixes. Contributors are encouraged to report potential vulnerabilities through secure channels, such as encrypted communication or dedicated issue trackers. All reports are reviewed promptly, and patches are developed and deployed as needed. We recommend users keep their installations up-to-date to benefit from the latest security improvements.

## Future Plans

A formal Information Security Management System (ISMS) is not yet implemented in the CoreAI3D project. As the project grows, we plan to evaluate and potentially adopt structured frameworks like ISO 27001 to enhance our security posture. This may include regular security audits, automated vulnerability scanning, and expanded contributor training. We welcome community input on security enhancements and are committed to evolving our practices to meet emerging standards.
